Linux/FreeBSD daemon i wrote a long time ago. As far as i know it detects all of port scan methods (including SYN scan and UDP scan). Easy to use, configurable, user-friendly etc etc.

Features:
	- executes "ban command" specified in .conf file
	- allows to specify number of scans to tolerate from one IP
	- writes log to syslog/stdio
	- whitelist
	- uid/gid (rawsock used, access to firewall on FreeBSD is needed)
